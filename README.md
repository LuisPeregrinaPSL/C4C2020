  ### Project Description
  Our solution includes 2 main components:

**Data analyzer:**
Online platform receiving data about the time that people stays at home on different areas. The platform uses kibana and elastic search to build real time graphs showing which areas better meet the stay at home restrictions.

**Mobile application / Data collector:**
The data collection is done using an app that the users will install on their mobile phones, this application allows the users to track how long they have stayed at home and sends the statistics to the data analyzer.
By using gamification, the app allows the user to build a forest at their virtual home and contribute to their community forest as follows:

-	For each 6 consecutive hours at home, user will get a three.
-	For every 3 threes that he gets, one is also added to his community forest.
-	If he leaves home before the 6 hours needed to get a tree, then a new one starts growing from 0.
-	As more threes are added to the forest, user can get additional items and go through different contribution levels.

There is a GPS tracking component monitoring if the users moves enough to consider that they leave home.

**Problem solved:**
One of the most critical actions to prevent the spread of the virus that is being implemented on all countries is the lackdown and different stay at home initiatives. 
There are multiple actions implemented by governments to persue/force people to stay at home, however these actions are usually applied to complete areas and cities, a more focalized application of these measures could help to get better results.

**Benefits**
Government will be able to optimize resources
Quickinsights about the results of measures implemented for Stay at home initiatives
Better understending of areas that may require more help
