## Staying@Home Business Rules
- When user installs the app a new Tree starts growing.
- A counters is tracking time that the user has been at home
- After 6 consecutive hours at home, user will get a tree, after getting a Tree the growing couter is restarted and a new Tree starts growing;
- If user leaves home before the 6 hours needed to get a tree, one is removed from his forest, and a new one starts growing from 0 once he gets back home.
- To move from level 1 to level 2, user needs to complete 5 trees on the current week, each new level requires 2 more trees to be completed to go to next level, e.g. to move from level 2 to 3, 7 trees needs to be completed and so on.
