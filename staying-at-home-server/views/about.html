            <h1>The Challenge</h1>
            <p>The most effective action to prevent the virus spread on health emergencies is the lockdown and/or stay at home
            Policy.</p>
            <p>However, countries are facing challenges to make sure people meets these policies. As a result, there are multiple
            actions implemented by governments to motivate people to stay at home, these actions are being applied to broad
            areas such as cities, states, countries:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Security checkpoints on streets</li>
                <li>Policy patrols asking people to go home</li>
                <li>Multiple advertising and sensitization campaigns</li>
                <li>Sanitizer tunnels in crowded places</li>
            </ul>

            <h1>Our Solution</h1>
            <p><b>Staying@Home App:</b> tracks how long the users have stayed at home and sends the statistics to the Staying@Home Dashboard.
            </p>
            <p>By using gamification and VR, the app allows the user to build a forest at their virtual home and contribute to the
            community. 
            
            Basic Game rules for v1.0:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For each 6 consecutive hours at home, user gets a tree</li>
                <li>Every 10, 20, 80, 120, etc trees, the user is moved to next level</li>
                <li>If user leaves home before the 6 hours needed to get a tree, the one in progress is deleted, and then a new one
                    starts growing from 0 once user gets back home.</li>
                <li>As more trees are added to the forest, user can get additional items and go through different contribution
                    levels</li>
                <li>There is a GPS tracking component monitoring if the users moves enough to consider that they leave home</li>
                <li>User can share on social networks their progress and achievements.</li>
                
            </ul>    
            <p><b>Staying@Home Dashboard:</b> Online platform receiving data and statistics about the time that people stays at
              home. The platform uses kibana and elastic search to build real time graphs showing which areas better meet the stay
              at home restrictions.</p>
