<h1>Staying@Home Team</h1>
<p>We are an open source project designed to build solutions focused on making people stay at home more straightforward,
    using gamification, our mobile app was designed to help people to get some fun during lockdown, while contributing
    to reduce risk of virus spread.</p>
<p>Our online analytics platform allows government, NGOs and all interested people to analyze the progress of staying at
    home policies on different areas.</p>

<h1>The Challenge</h1>
<p>The most effective action to prevent the virus spread on health emergencies is the lockdown and/or stay at home
    policies.</p>
<p>However, countries are facing big challenges to make sure people meets the policies. As a result, there are multiple
    actions implemented by governments to invite/force people to stay at home, these actions are being applied to broad
    areas such as cities, states, countries:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Security checkpoints on streets</li>
    <li>Policy patrols asking people to go home</li>
    <li>Multiple advertising and sensitization campaigns</li>
    <li>Sanitizer tunnels in crowded places</li>
</ul>

<h1>Our Solution</h1>
<p><b>Staying@Home Dashboard:</b> Online platform receiving data and statistics about the time that people stays at
    home. The platform uses kibana and elastic search to build real time graphs showing which areas better meet the stay
    at home restrictions.</p>
<p><b>Staying@Home App:</b> tracks how long the users have stayed at home and sends the statistics to the data analyzer.
</p>
<p>By using gamification and AR, the app allows the user to build a forest at their virtual home and contribute to their
    community:</p>
<ul>
    <li>For each 6 consecutive hours at home, user gets a tree</li>
    <li>Every 6 trees, the user is move to next level</li>
    <li>If user leaves home before the 6 hours needed to get a tree, the one in progress is deleted, and then a new one
        starts growing from 0 once user gets back home.</li>
    <li>As more trees are added to the forest, user can get additional items and go through different contribution
        levels</li>
    <li>There is a GPS tracking component monitoring if the users moves enough to consider that they leave home</li>
    <li>User can share on social networks their progress and achievements.</li>
</ul>
